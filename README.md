Yesterday:
Meeting:Internal SRE/ AppD Planning & Review
Fine-tuned Fapolicyd to include additional permissions required by the Events Service and Elasticsearch.
Reinstalled the Events Service, which is now reporting as HEALTHY. The configuration to connect it to the Controller is pending.

Today:
Meeting: AppD Restructure Session
Noticed that the Firewall and SELinux configurations reset the modifications I made today by the next day. Need to review these settings properly and create a ticket to make the Firewall and SELinux changes permanent.
Reviewing the AppD PreProd and Prod Controller MAP applications.

Blockers:
- None
