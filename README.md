We can increase the Analytics Data Retention period once we confirm that there is enough available storage for the increase.

​W​e need to confirm the current storage usage on the Events Service nodes and also provide the total storage capacity. This will help us determine if we need to expand the storage or if we have sufficient capacity.

Instructions for ​this task:

​Update the settings, log in to the Controller Admin panel (admin.jsp), go to "Controller Settings," and then update the Analytics Retention Period.
