Good morning, MAM496 is still on hold. We can do one of two things.
1. We can keep waiting for the admin team to fix the problem.
or
2. We can proceed with reinstalling the Events Service, which should only take 1-2 days at most.
Choice 2 is better because it will save us time. We've already waited more than a month, and the admin team has made no progress. 

FYI, if we proceed with reinstall we may still face fapolicyd permisison related errors, in that case we will need admin help too
Please let me know which option we should go with.
