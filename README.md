Hello Damian,

Please see the list of questions we will discuss below during tomorrowâ€™s call.

What language are the RTX applications written?
Other than Splunk and AppD, are there other APM tools the team uses?
Since RTX already has Splunk and AppD, are all the critical Applications instrumented in AppD and Splunk? 
Please provide more insights into Composable 2.0 nodes and HCI edge nodes. 
According to the documentation, the VMs run within/under the HCI and Composable 2.0 nodes.
Was the failover test from Edge Node 2 to Edge Node 1 successful?
How do you deploy VMs to the HCI and Composable 2.0 edge nodes?

Thank you,
