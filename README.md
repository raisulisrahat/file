After consulting with Jonathan, we learned that the Sandbox and Events Service instances are being upgraded to RHEL 8. We might encounter errors when starting the Controller after the upgrade is complete. This is likely because we are already experiencing some permission-related errors on the Events Service instance, which is running on RHEL 8.
