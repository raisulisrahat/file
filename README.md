Subject: Health Rule Suppression

Hi Team,

I did some research last night regarding Action Suppression in AppDynamics for managing health rule alerts during maintenance windows.

With the Action Suppression, we can prevent health rule violations from triggering alerts, notifications, or incidents during maintenance periods without disabling the health rules. Additionally, we can disable agent reporting during this time, preventing any false data from being reported. If configured, we can also set the Health Rules not to act when no data is reported, avoiding unnecessary violations.

For more control, we can scope the suppression to specific health rules, ensuring only selected violations are suppressed during the maintenance window.

This approach allows us to manage maintenance more effectively without disrupting ongoing monitoring.

Thanks,
Sayed
